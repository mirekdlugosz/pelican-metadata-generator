- add command line switches
  - debugging level
  - pelican data source directory (directories?)
  - target metadata format
- take file name from pelicanconf?
  Currently our filename is <slug>.<ext>, whereas users might prefer other formats
- read file and load metadata into user interface?
  This way app might be used to modify metadata of existing file
- improve authors support
  Current metaphor does not really allow for easy selection of
  multiple authors. 
- verify portability
  Both python and Qt are cross-platform, so this application should
  work on different operating systems. But it has never been tested.
- handle `&` in read metadata
  `&` is treated specially by Qt. We should escape it in and out
  when sending it to view and back to model
